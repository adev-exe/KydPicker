            With keyboard buliding there are really only six major components With keyboard buliding there are really
            only six major component that are
            Necessary for a standard build. These parts are as follows; A PCB, A Case, A Plate, a set
            Of Stabilizers, a set of switches, and a set keycaps. There are of course other components. But those are
            mainly for aesthetics or for the board to make a better sound. These would be items like pcb-plate foam,
            pcb-case foam, LED's, LED diffusers, aviator USB cables, gasket mount band, risers etc. We hope following
            guide will help you on your quest and Happy Building!

            The PCB is the most important part of the keyboard. It is what gives the keyboard life. When trying to come
            up with a build, there are centain sizes of PCB that we recommend to stick to, 60%, 75%, 80%, 90%, and 100%.
            The reason for this is that these sizes have the most support and components on the market right now. In
            addition to thinking about the size of the PCB, you must think about the type of PCB you want for your
            build. For the beginner level, we suggest a Hot-Swappable PCB as there is no soldering at all. If you fancy
            yourself handy with electronics then you can either go for a Standard PCB or a Through-hole PCB. The
            Standard only requires you to solder the switches and the Through-hole requires you to solder everything
            from diodes to the USB connector. </p>

                <p class="py-5">The Case is what holds all of the components and is one of the main factors that
                    contributes the the
                    sound generated from a keyboard. Cases come in many type of material such as plastic, wood, carbon
