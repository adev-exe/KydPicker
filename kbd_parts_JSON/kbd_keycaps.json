Using a combination of both popular and agnostic modifier legends, this base kit should provide wide physical compatibility with a large array of keyboard types, including Full-size, 1800s, Tenkeyless, 60-75%, Split/Alice, Ortholinear, 40%, and Ergodoxian.\nThe Grey Kit contains grey-colored versions of the accent-colored keys from base along with an additional R3 Stepped key with an agnostic legend.\nThe Spätlese Kit provides “NorDe” support. It provides the additional legends used by the German, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Estonian, & Fareoese layouts. Spätlese, which literally means “Late Harvest” in German, is a wine grown along the western rivers of Germany. Legend has it that this wine’s invention came about by accident. A courier carrying orders from the Bishop of Fulda to begin the harvest was delayed by 14 days; the grapes succumbed to “noble rot” before the late harvest and yielded an unexpectedly good wine (Spätlese on Wikipedia).\nThe Novelties Kit for Late Harvest is intentionally small and should be priced very competitively. The novelty designs themselves are still a work-in-progress. Just two designs are planned, both following the theme of Late Harvest wine, with the intent of making them viable replacements for the Escape key or Windows/Super keys.\nRenders"

I've been asked by KBDfans to design a set to be produced by Enjoypbt based on the old Cherry G81-3000 set.So far, it has been decided that it will follow the original design except that it will have Text+Icon modifiers rather than just icons and the Prt Sc/Sys Rq key will be done in green like the original.I have added a Super, Code and diamond icon OS keys of varying sizes. My rationale is that the Super key was more popular than Code so I've added 1.5u and 1.25u sizes for these. I've added 1u Code instead of Super because 1u the Super legend looks tight on 1u. I have only included 1u diamond keys because they can double up as 1u Fn keys for split R-shift and they are harder to centre on anything larger than 1u during manufacturing.\nGroup Buy Date: Dec 22th, 2021- Jan 22th, 2022\nSpecs\nPBT material\nCherry Profile\nDye-sub\nManufacturer: enjoypbt\nCompatible with Cherry MX switches and MX-style clones\nDesigner: GOK\nVendors\nGlobal: KBDfans\nUS: Mekibo\nCanada: Apexkeyboards\nEurope: Oblotzky Industries\nOceania: Daily Clack\nKorea: Swagkeys\nKITS\nRenders"

The answer is my existential depression (sigh). Just kidding. Maybe not. Who knows, let's move on. Swiftly.\nWhat if that crack on the sidewalk did break someone's grandma's back? What if the Hindenburg never blew up, and we didn't abandon blimps as a society? What if one little point on the timeline was changed ever so slightly? That is Chaos Theory.\nColor Inspiration: I was going through my late father's comics collection when I stumbled upon a box of old sci-fi artwork from the 70s and 80s that stunned me. While it is hard to put colors to the abstract themes of chaos theory, I found that these comics and the dystopian or sometimes euphoric scenes that they depict did a wonderful job of synthesizing the concepts of parallel dimensions, alternate realities, and much more into lush color palettes.\nSPECS\nProfile: Cherry Profile\nMaterial: ABS material\nProduction Method: Double-shot\nManufacturer: GMK Electronic Design GmbH in Germany\nCompatibility: Compatible with Cherry and Cherry MX clones\nArtisan Keycaps Specs\nHIBI Butterfly Metal Artisan: Brass base with colorful PVD coating and a luminous glow enamel fill\nKeylabs Crucible Metal Artisan: Aluminum base anodized to match the modifiers dark purple and randomly infilled with a combination of two of the pink, green, purple, yellow, and red accent colors from the set.There are 20 possible combinations, please forgive the lack of static renders.\nSwitch Specs\nManufacturer: Tecsee\nColor: Rainbow aluminum-plated full nylon housings\nDetails: Linear POM stem (3.9 mm travel) color-matched to the pink accent of GMK Chaos Theory\nPressure: 68g\nSpring: 15 mm standard gold springs\nFriendly Reminds: Each switch's rainbow metal plating will be different and appear differently.\nNotes:\nThis specific colorway of Tecsee's metal-plated switches will only run for the GMK Chaos Theory GB and will not be made again.\nEVERY SWITCH WILL LOOK DIFFERENT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PLATING PROCESS\nDeskmat Specs\nSize: 900 mm x 400 mm x 4 mm\nProduction Method: Stitched Edges\nVendors\nUS: Mekibo\nCA: AshKeebs\nSA: FancyCustoms\nME: CandyKeys\nUK: Proto[Typist]\nOCE: SwitchKeys\nSEA: iLumKB\nPHI: ZionStudios\nSK: KLC Playground\nInt'l: KBDfans\nDISCLAIMER\nEvery Singularity switch will appear differently due to the aluminum plating process, please see pictures for variance.

F13 requiring boards and 40% keyboards (R3 1.50U Enter, R3 1.25U Tab, R2 1.75U Backspace) are also supported.\nNovelties explainer:\nThe main novelty that repeats in the accent colors is the symbol of chaos.\nThe concepts of ordered and disordered systems are two commonly studied and connected topics within chaos theory that I wanted to represent artistically in the novelties. In the paired columns of novelties, the symbol of chaos and the symbol of extropy (the extent of a living or organizational system's capacity and drive for improvement and growth) are featured. Continuing down from R2-R4, two columns of novelties depict fundamental shapes (hexagon, square, triangle, and circle/spiral) in ordered and disordered forms.\nThe ISO enter novelty is an abstract rendition of the nautilus shell/logarithmic spiral motif (for anyone interested in what exactly the spiral ratio is, I recommend reading this and this).\nTwo R4 1.25U and 1.50U text novelties commemorate famous scientists who have contributed significantly to the field of chaos theory.\nDeskmats\nMinimal Shapes Deskmat\nButterfly Effect Deskmat by Tabijey\nKeylabs Crucible Metal Artisan\nAluminum base anodized to match the modifiers dark purple and randomly infilled with a combination of two of the pink, green, purple, yellow, and red accent colors from the set.\nThere are 20 possible combinations, please forgive the lack of static renders.\nHIBI Butterfly Metal Artisan\nBrass base with colorful PVD coating and a luminous glow enamel fill.\nStatic angles:\nTecsee Singularity switches\nRenders"

Nearly 6 months later, I had time.When looking at the idea of doing a buy of relegendables for beige (the best colourway) I realised there hadn’t been a run of these for a while and that maybe people want them in more than just beige. So, I’ve included a few options. There are 7 kits in total. There are 5 kits of blanks and 2 kits with front printed legends.\nWhy the plus?Well in the past these kits had only usually been done in single colours or to suit a specific set, so the plus is to set it apart from those.For more information on Relegendable kits and their history, please refer to the deskthority link below.https://deskthority.net/wiki/Relegendable_key\nWHAT ARE THOSE!!??\nPhoto credit to TaehaTypes for the beautiful looking Rev 1 with WOB on it. As for the beige beauty, if anyone who’s who owns the photo, please let me know.\nUnfortunately, I don’t own any of these caps to take my own photos, part of the reason I wanted to run this GB so much.\nKITS\nFront printed kits – CR base and U9 base.\nThese include front printed kits in the two colourways we assumed would be the most popular. The legends chosen will cover the top row of a TKL/full size as well as the nav cluster. While yes the row height would be better if it matched the rows of the nav cluster, I’m not sure GMK will be able to cater to this request and as far as I know they only make them in the R1 profile.\nBlanks kits – CR, WS1, U9, L9 and N9.These kits will cover a range of common colourways used frequently on GMK sets. If you are unsure if these kits will match your set, please ask in the comments and I’ll get back to you ASAP. The short version, is it will cover you for most things WOB or BOW, sets with white alphas (that aren’t WS2), all the classic beige variants and anything with dolch coloured mods. Recent sets that some of these will work with (blanks kits) include the Desert base of Botanical R2, Monochrome mods, Minimal, Serika Accents (to be confirmed), Sixes, Modern Desko, Patisserie, Stealth, Thinkcaps, Beta, Dolch R5 etc. You get the idea. They’re useful for many, many kits. The choice to include sets of 10 was based on how many people would need and was the best value compromise we could come up with. The goal was to balance the needs of those who only want a few and those who (most commonly) will want to fill the top row of a TKL.\nBoard Renders"

As a kid, I was often frightened by horror movies until I found the works of R.L. Stine at a Scholastic Book Fair. His way of storytelling captured my imagination and helped me to rationalize my fears, desensitizing me to the horrors that once frightened me. Which is what the horror genre has done for so many of us throughout its existence. Monster thrillers in particular were always my favorite though, taking the boogiemen that we checked under the bed for as kids and making them into metaphysical constructs that were more logical and rational for our brains, with weaknesses. Even sometimes, like in the case of Frankenstein's monster, showing that maybe the monster isn't a monster but just misunderstood and fearful. These stories span cultures and generations but it wasn't until horror entertainment did we have a common vision and explanation for what we could not explain. Where we no longer feared the monsters in the dark but instead sought them for our amusement. I hope my vision can bring you joy and nostalgia, to harken you to the first moments and the many great ones that being \"scared\" has given us.\n☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠"

MERCURY EXPLAINED\nMercury is an element with the symbol Hg on the periodic table. Mercury is commonly known as quicksilver and the reason why the symbol is Hg is because it was once called hydrargyrum. Mercury is the only known metallic element to be in a liquid state at standard atmospheric conditions. Mercury occurs naturally throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercury sulfide). Vermilion is a pigment created from grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercury sulfide.\nMercury is commonly known to be used in thermometers and barometers. These devices are used to tell differences in the atmosphere, and are used by weather forecasters and scientists alike. Mercury is also used in amalgam (mercury and metal alloy) in dental restoration.\nPoisoning due to Mercury is a result from exposure to water-soluble forms such as mercury chloride or methylmercury, through inhalation of the vapors or ingestion.\nMercury is one of my favorite elements and is the inspiration for this set!\nII. COLORS\nColors:\nAlphas: Pantone 428C Alpha Legends: GMK N9\nModifiers: GMK N9 Modifier Legends: WS2\nWhite Accent: GMK WS2 White Accent Legends: CMK CR\nRed Accent: Pantone 7628C Red Accent Legends: GMK WS2\nIII. KITS\nNovelties Explained\nPeriodic Symbol: This is the symbol that can be found on the periodic table that represents the element Mercury, its molar mass, and atomic mass.\nConical / Erlenmeyer Flask: A common flask used in chemistry for experiments that can be used to heat or boil liquids, it is also used in titration.\nRhombohedron: This is the symbol used to represent the crystal structure of the element Mercury.\nAltimeter: Although modern altimeters use what is known as an aneroid, Mercury was used in the basis and invention of barometers to sense pressure changes in the environment.\nAt higher altitude pressure decreases, and thus a change in the environment causes the aneroid to sense the altitude.\nAlchemical Symbol: This was the symbol used to represent Hydrargyrum (Mercury) in alchemy. It is also the astrological symbol for the planet Mercury.\nThermometer Scale: Mercury is used in thermometers, however thermometers that contain a red liquid is alcohol to which red coloring has been added.\nIV.
